      <p class="font-karla pt-5">Hi,<br><br>My journey started as a freelance graphic designer working for small clients around Antwerp. After finishing a Frond end Development course I started working at A.S. Adventure where I created mail and webpage designs, turning them into HTML and CSS.<br><br>This was not enough to scratch my coding itch, which led me to following additional courses online such as: VueJS, NuxtJS, Adobe XD etc.<br><br>If you would like to get know me more, please follow me on the links provided below. or view my resume <a style="text-decoration: underline" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7rM0vHksY_xNURHQlJ2UjFTa0k/view?usp=sharing">here</a></p>
